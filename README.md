# Image Classification Project

## Project Overview
This project focuses on developing an image classification model that can identify and categorize objects within images. Using the CIFAR-10 dataset, the model is trained to classify images into 10 different classes: Plane, Car, Bird, Cat, Deer, Dog, Frog, Horse, Ship, and Truck.

## Dataset

### CIFAR-10 Dataset
- The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.
- The dataset is divided into 50,000 training images and 10,000 testing images.
